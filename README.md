# Assignment 1
Assignment demonstrating understanding of how GitHub, GitPod and Markdown interact as a Source Control and Technical Document Writing.

**# My First Markdown #**

Welcome to my first mark down where I will attempt to explain the process of my code.

# Purpose of the website #

This very brief website has been made to demonstrate my understanding of some of the things I have learned so far during the Level 5 - Web Development course run by College of West Anglia and Code Institute.

I have tried to keep it sweet and simple and not go overboard or too in-depth as I usually do!

# Value of the website #

This example website will give lecturer, Nigel Edwards, and insight into my progress during the course as an opportunity to grade my work and provide any improvement factors.

# The Basics #

## GitHub & GitPod ##

- **GitHub** In order to display the work for Nigel to grade, I created a repository on GitHub and gave access to Nigel to review. Here I applied the correct settings to publish my repository.

- **GitPod** After I had created my repository I used GitPod to enter my code. Any changes made to the code, I added a message to explain what change was made, confirmed the change and synced it to GitHub.

## HTML ##

I created an <index.html> file to write my HTML code. 

## CSS ##

I created a stylesheet <style.css> to apply my CSS code.
